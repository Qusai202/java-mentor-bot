# Java Mentor Bot 🤖☕

Java Mentor Bot is an AI-powered, beginner-friendly educational chatbot built with Java.
It helps students learn Java programming interactively through a console-based interface.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To provide clear, step-by-step explanations of core Java concepts by combining:
- A local knowledge base for fast, reliable answers
- AI-generated responses for dynamic explanations

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Java 17+
- VS Code with Java Extensions
- Java HttpClient (Java 11+)
- JSON / Map-based local knowledge base
- AI API (OpenAI or similar)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Clean Architecture (UI, Business Logic, AI Integration)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt Engineering for educational responses
- Safe and efficient API request/response handling

## ⚠️ Note
This is a demo project. Due to API key limitations, the bot may not answer every
possible Java question, but it works perfectly for core Java concepts and provides
step-by-step explanations.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Hands-on experience integrating AI into Java applications
- Designing layered and scalable educational architectures
- Applying prompt engineering in real-world use cases

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- GUI-based version
- Web-based version
- Expanded and more advanced knowledge base
