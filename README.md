# Java Mentor Bot 🤖☕

An AI-powered, beginner-friendly educational chatbot built with Java.
The bot helps students learn Java programming interactively through a
console-based interface.

## 🎯 Project Goal
To provide clear, step-by-step explanations of core Java concepts using
a combination of a local knowledge base and AI-generated responses.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Java 17+
- VS Code with Java Extensions
- Java HttpClient (Java 11+)
- JSON / Map-based local knowledge base
- AI API (OpenAI or similar)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Applied
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Clean Architecture (UI, Business Logic, AI Layer)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Prompt Engineering for educational responses
- Safe API request/response handling

## ⚠️ Note
This is a demo project. Due to API key limitations, the bot may not answer
every possible Java question, but it works perfectly for core concepts.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Integrating AI into Java applications
- Designing scalable educational tools
- Applying prompt engineering in real applications

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- GUI-based version
- Web-based version
- Expanded knowledge base
